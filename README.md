# ML Based Career Counsellor

The ML Based Career Counsellor is a Streamlit app that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to suggest job positions based on the user's skills. The app asks the user to enter their name, region, date of birth and select the skills they possess from a list of skills. It then generates a prompt using the user's selected skills and asks OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to suggest ten job positions based on the user's skills.

The app uses the PIL library to create a report containing the user's name, selected skills, and the suggested job positions. The report is generated as an image and saved to the local file system.
